SNAKE

Snake, the timeless arcade game, is back! In snake, players control a snake with never ending hunger as it navigates through a field in search of food! The more food the snake eats, the longer and longer it grows. Just be sure to not collide with yourself or the walls or the snake’s a goner. Compete for high scores and have fun in this adventure!

## MVP Goals:

Create a startup screen with a start button
Create a snake character that moves with arrow keys
Generate food at random spots for the snake to eat
Have the snake grow in length as it eats
Have the game end when snake collides with itself or the boundary
Include a game over message
Display players score as well as high score
Provide option to restart game at any point


## Stretch Goals

Have snake increase in speed as it eats
Add bad food that makes the snake shrink instead of grow
Have the type (image) of food randomly change


## Potential Roadblocks

I'm not yet sure how to have the snake’s speed increase as it eats
Keeping track of if the snake has ran into itself or not may be a challenge
